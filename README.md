An algorithm to improve the efficiency of warehouses 
by minimizing the distance traveled daily by the forklifts.

It solves the following optimization problem

Our optimization problem can be solved by linear programming methods using Gurobi packages. 
The preliminary results show that it is possible to approach 20% improvement in distance and 3% improvement in time.
